**Aims of OpenBioMaps project**

**There are two objectives of the openbiomaps project:**

    *  First, to maintain an open and free biological database service, and; 
    *  Second, to develop biological data handling software applications. 
    
       The openbiomaps project thus provides a stable background for open and free biological databases, specifically for scientists and conservationists, and its customizable toolset allows for the easy access and management of data.

**Minor objectives**

   * Aim of the OpenBioMaps project register,
   * share and present occurrence data of organisms with biotical and abiotical informations (for nature conservation or biodiversity research)  in GIS format (Geographic Information System) based on several citizen science projects
   * The further aim of OpenBioMaps is support the higher education with the framework, with the open utilization of its data and with the developmental capacity of the system.
   * OpenBioMaps use applications with open source code, furthermore OpenBiomaps is a database and framework, which contains decentralized, minor databases with low cost claim.
   * The target audience of OpenBioMaps is the natural science and nature conservation profession, as well as the preparatory bodies of plans, strategies, and decisions concern nature conservation.
   * Az OpenBioMaps knowledge sharing tool based on volounteering, which builds upon people who are recipient to complete data publicity and they amplify it.
   * The database is open to the different biotical data, as well as it is open to collaborations with other databases.
   * OpenBioMaps can serve data so that these data could be use across the webpage or in desktop applications.
   * All of the OpenBioMaps services are freely available.


**Main properties:**

   * Creating and managing custom databases
   * Easy data import from varios formats (ods, xls, xlsx, gpx, shp, csv ...)
   * Repeatable and citable queries
   * DataCite DOI
   * Exporting data into various formats (csv, gpx)
   * Accessing data from remote databases or desktop applications (e.g R, QGIS)
   * Decentralized community
   * Customizable data management interfaces
   * Customizable data collecting interfaces
   * Free and open softwares
   * Open data

Getting started
===============

Getting started

To create your own database you will need a server. This can be your own server, a rented server, or a server already maintained by someone else to serve OpenBioMaps.

It is easiest to create a new database on an existing OpenBioMaps server. Check the list of known servers to see if you have access to one of them. There are dedicated public servers that host many different databases.

If you need more capacity or you want to control access to the entire server, you can install a dedicated server. It's not that complicated. Here is a tutorial: https://openbiomaps.org/documents/en/server_install.html

If you want to create your own database project on an existing server, you must have access to a database on that server. Once you have this, you can easily set up your own database project there, the steps for which you can see here: https://openbiomaps.org/documents/en/tutorials.html#new-project and
