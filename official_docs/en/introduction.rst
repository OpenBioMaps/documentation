**Aims of OpenBioMaps project**

**There are two objectives of the openbiomaps project:**

    *  First, to maintain an open and free biological database service, and; 
    *  Second, to develop biological data handling software applications. 
    
       The openbiomaps project thus provides a stable background for open and free biological databases, specifically for scientists and conservationists, and its customizable toolset allows for the easy access and management of data.

**Minor objectives**

   * Aim of the OpenBioMaps project register,
   * share and present occurrence data of organisms with biotical and abiotical informations (for nature conservation or biodiversity research)  in GIS format (Geographic Information System) based on several citizen science projects
   * The further aim of OpenBioMaps is support the higher education with the framework, with the open utilization of its data and with the developmental capacity of the system.
   * OpenBioMaps use applications with open source code, furthermore OpenBiomaps is a database and framework, which contains decentralized, minor databases with low cost claim.
   * The target audience of OpenBioMaps is the natural science and nature conservation profession, as well as the preparatory bodies of plans, strategies, and decisions concern nature conservation.
   * Az OpenBioMaps knowledge sharing tool based on volounteering, which builds upon people who are recipient to complete data publicity and they amplify it.
   * The database is open to the different biotical data, as well as it is open to collaborations with other databases.
   * OpenBioMaps can serve data so that these data could be use across the webpage or in desktop applications.
   * All of the OpenBioMaps services are freely available.


**Main properties:**

   * Creating and managing custom databases
   * Easy data import from varios formats (ods, xls, xlsx, gpx, shp, csv ...)
   * Repeatable and citable queries
   * DataCite DOI
   * Exporting data into various formats (csv, gpx)
   * Accessing data from remote databases or desktop applications (e.g R, QGIS)
   * Decentralized community
   * Customizable data management interfaces
   * Customizable data collecting interfaces
   * Free and open softwares
   * Open data
