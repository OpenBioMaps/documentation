Invitations
***********

By default, all logged-in users can send an invitation to join the project/database.

The invitation will be sent to the invited person in the selected language. It is also possible to add a personal message to the automatically generated invitation message.

Invitations sent out will automatically expire after two weeks, i.e. the time the invited person has to join the project. If you want to join later, you will need to send a new invitation.

The number of active invitations is limited by default (11), which can be changed in the local_vars.php.inc file. If set to 0, only project hosts can send invitations.
