## 1. Introduction

In this manual, I will attempt to do two things:
 * Walk you trough the basic steps of creating and configuring a database, using the OBM interface.
 * Try to cover the basic functions provided by the database, local gekko nodes.

Most of the steps will be illustrated with screenshots, and I will  also include a few code lines witch I used in SQL and the Debian terminal. Even tough, endepth SQL programing knowledge isn't required to follow the steps of founding a database, some basic knowledge is recommended for a better undersdtanding of the OBM system.

There will be several updates updates to this manual, and new topoics will be added, based on request or big system changes/updates.
