## 1. Introduction
<p>
Par sor meghato szoveg az OBM - rol

In this manual, I will attempt to do two things:
 * Walk you trough the basic steps of creating and configuring a database, using the OBM interface.
 * Try to cover the basic functions provided by the database, local gekko nodes.

Most of the steps will be illustrated with screenshots, and I will also include a few code lines which I used in SQL and the Debian terminal. Even tough, in-depth SQL programming knowledge isn't required to follow the steps of founding a database, some basic knowledge is recommended for a better understanding of the OBM system.The operating system that I'm using, is Ubuntu (Linux), but you should be able to follow along. If you have any questions regarding the discussed topics, or things I didn't covered, you can ask them on the official OBM forums or on one of the developers [mailing lists](http://openbiomaps.org/community/?lang=en) (if you are new to OBM, the Biomaps mailing list is probably the best option).

There will be several updates to this manual, and new topics will be added, based on request or big system changes/updates. These changes will be listed in the last chapter of the manual.

## 2. Creating a database
<p>
In this chapter I will focus on walking you trough the steps required, to found your own database.

To be able to create a database, firs you need an invitation, from someone who is already an OBM user. If you don't have such an acquaintance, you can simply request one using the mailing list's mentioned in the previous chapter. If you receive an invitation, you will be able to register, and become an OBM user.

If you have done the previous step, you will be able to access your profile, after you login (Fig.1).
