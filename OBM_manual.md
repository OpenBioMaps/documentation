## 1. Introduction


In this manual, I will attempt to do two things:
 * Walk you trough the basic steps of creating and configuring a database, using the OBM interface.
 * Try to cover the basic functions provided by the database, local gekko nodes.

Most of the steps will be illustrated with screenshots, and I will also include a few code lines which I used in SQL and the Debian terminal. Even tough, in-depth SQL programing knowledge isn't required to follow the steps of founding a database, some basic knowledge is recommended for a better understanding of the OBM system.The operating system that I'm using, is Ubuntu (Linux), but you should be able to follow along. If you have any questions regarding the discussed topics, or things I didn't covered, you can ask them on the official OBM forums or on one of the developers [mailing lists](http://lists.openbiomaps.org/mailman/listinfo) (kerdezz ra Mikitol).

There will be several updates to this manual, and new topics will be added, based on request or big system changes/updates.
